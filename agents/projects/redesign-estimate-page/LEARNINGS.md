# Learnings About the User's Preferences and Feedback

## General UI Preferences (User)
- The user prefers clear, readable layouts with good hierarchy and spacing.
- The user wants the most important numbers (CO2 per person) to be visually dominant and centered.
- Supporting text (units, summary) should be visually secondary, but still readable and well-aligned according to the user.
- The user values proportional sizing: big numbers should be much bigger than supporting text, but not excessively so.
- The user wants the card to avoid excessive width on large screens, preferring a more compact look.

## Specific Component Feedback (OverviewCard)
- The user wants the big CO2 number to be very large (now 1.5x bigger than before), centered vertically and horizontally.
- The unit label ("kg CO2e pr. person") should be directly below the number, same size as before, and not too small or too large, per the user's preference.
- The summary text ("x kg co2e for x personer") should be readable, about 1.25x bigger than default, and aligned at the bottom of the card, as the user prefers.
- The user does not want the summary text to be bold.
- The user wants the card width to be about half or a third of the screen on laptops, not stretching too wide.
- The user prefers subtle spacing adjustments (not too much, not too little) between number and unit.
- The user iterates quickly and values seeing visual changes before deciding on final details.

## Design Process (User)
- The user often changes their mind after seeing the result, and prefers to experiment with size, spacing, and alignment until it feels right.
- The user provides feedback based on screenshots and live previews, not just code.
- The user wants changes to be made incrementally and responsively to their feedback.
