---

## Comprehensive Project Context

This document consolidates all learnings, patterns, and context from the redesign-estimate-page project. It serves as the complete reference for understanding the implementation, user preferences, and established patterns that future development should follow.

### Project Overview
- **Goal**: Redesign the estimate page with improved layout, real-time progress tracking, and comprehensive data visualization
- **Architecture**: SvelteKit frontend with FastAPI backend, Redis for job tracking, comprehensive component system
- **Success Metrics**: User satisfaction with visual hierarchy, component reusability, maintainable codebase

## Implementation Success Summary

### Backend Enhancements
- **Real-time Status Tracking**: Granular job status updates (PROCESSING → EXTRACTING_TEXT → EXTRACTING_RECIPE → ESTIMATING_WEIGHTS → ESTIMATING_CO2 → PREPARING_OUTPUT → COMPLETED)
- **Comparison Data Endpoint**: New `/comparison` endpoint providing car, flight, washing machine, budget, and average person comparisons
- **Nutritional Data Integration**: Complete energy (kJ/kcal) and macronutrient data in all responses
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states with user-friendly messages
- **Performance**: Redis-based caching and rate limiting for optimal user experience

### Frontend Component System
- **OverviewCard**: Primary CO₂ display with user-validated visual hierarchy
- **BudgetComparison**: Percentage displays with educational modal content
- **EquivalentComparison**: Real-world comparisons with intuitive icons
- **NutritionChart**: Energy and macronutrient visualization using ApexCharts
- **Layout System**: Responsive design with mobile-first approach

### User Experience Achievements
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Large, centered primary numbers with clear supporting text
- **Information Organization**: Three main tabs with logical data grouping
- **Educational Value**: Info modals provide context without overwhelming interface
- **Responsive Design**: Excellent experience across device sizes
- **Real-time Feedback**: Progress indicators keep users engaged during processing

## Established Design Patterns & User Preferences

### Component Design System (CRITICAL for consistency)

#### Info Icon Pattern (Standardized)
**Required Implementation**:
```svelte
<Card class="p-4 relative {cardClass}">
  <button
    class="absolute top-2 right-2 text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-700 focus:outline-none"
    on:click={toggleModal}
    aria-label="Vis detaljer"
  >
    <InfoCircleOutline class="w-5 h-5" />
  </button>
  <!-- Component content -->
</Card>
```

**Key Requirements**:
- Card MUST have `relative` class and base padding (`p-4`)
- Info button uses `absolute top-2 right-2` positioning
- `cardClass` prop controls layout/sizing, NOT core positioning
- Standard hover states and accessibility attributes

#### Text Hierarchy Standards (User Validated)
- **Primary Numbers**: `text-3xl font-bold` or larger, centered vertically and horizontally
- **Unit Labels**: `text-xl font-bold` directly below primary numbers
- **Supporting Text**: `text-sm` or `text-base`, clearly secondary sizing
- **Descriptive Content**: Readable but not bold, positioned at bottom of containers

#### Layout Requirements (Critical)
- **Vertical Stacking**: Use `flex flex-col` for main layout, avoid `lg:flex-row` for tab positioning
- **Card Sizing**: Desktop cards should be 1/3 to 1/2 screen width (`lg:w-1/3`), not full-width
- **Height Standards**: Tab components use `min-h-80` with `py-12` padding
- **Spacing**: Consistent gap patterns (`gap-6`, `gap-12`) with subtle adjustments

### User Experience Principles (Validated through iteration)

#### Visual Preferences
- **Proportional Sizing**: Big numbers should be MUCH bigger than supporting text
- **Centered Focus**: Most important information should be centered and prominent  
- **Compact Layout**: Avoid excessive width stretching on large screens
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Obvious distinction between primary and secondary information

#### Design Process Insights
- **Iterative Feedback**: User prefers seeing changes before making final decisions
- **Visual Confirmation**: Screenshots and live previews essential for design validation
- **Incremental Changes**: Small adjustments to font sizes, spacing, alignment frequently requested
- **Quick Iteration**: Rapid feedback cycles lead to better final results

## Technical Architecture Learnings

### Flowbite Svelte Integration Success
- **Tabs Component**: `tabStyle="underline"` provides professional appearance
- **Chart Wrapper**: ApexCharts integration works excellently for data visualization
- **Card Flexibility**: Excellent base component with comprehensive customization via props
- **Modal Structure**: Consistent header/content/footer pattern for additional information

### Component Props Philosophy (Critical)
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Layout and sizing only
export let cardClass = "max-w-full";

// ❌ WRONG: Core positioning should not be in props
export let cardClass = "p-4 relative max-w-full";
```

**Principles**:
- Core styling (padding, positioning) belongs in component
- Props control layout variations (height, width, spacing)
- All height/padding customization via `cardClass` prop
- Never hardcode sizing in components

### Backend Integration Patterns

#### API Design Success
- **Job Management**: UUID-based tracking with Redis persistence
- **Status Granularity**: Detailed progress states for excellent UX
- **Data Separation**: Comparison data separate from estimation results
- **Type Safety**: Full Pydantic validation matching frontend TypeScript interfaces

#### Performance Optimization
- **Polling Strategy**: Efficient status checking without overwhelming backend
- **Caching Layers**: Redis, Google Cloud Storage, and browser caching
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful degradation at all system levels
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse while maintaining usability

## Development Standards & Context

### Code Quality Requirements (from project RULES.md)
- **Type Hints**: Comprehensive TypeScript in frontend, Python type hints in backend
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, clean separation of concerns
- **Readability**: Code clarity prioritized over brevity
- **Consistency**: Follow established patterns documented in this system

### Testing & Reliability
- **Async Testing**: `pytest-asyncio` for backend async functions
- **Component Testing**: Svelte component unit tests for critical functionality
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end API and frontend integration
- **Error Scenarios**: Comprehensive error state testing

### Environment & Deployment
- **Configuration**: Environment variables for all settings (API keys, cache options)
- **Docker Strategy**: Multi-stage builds for optimal container size
- **Cloud Deployment**: Google Cloud Run with proper secret management
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging for debugging and production oversight

## Key Success Factors for Future Development

### What Made This Project Successful
1. **User-Centered Iteration**: Regular feedback with visual confirmation
2. **Component Modularity**: Each component has single responsibility
3. **Consistent Patterns**: Info icons, text hierarchy, and layout standards
4. **Prop-based Flexibility**: Styling customization without component rewrites
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with progressive desktop enhancement
6. **Backend Integration**: Clean API design supporting frontend requirements

### Critical Implementation Guidelines
1. **Follow Established Patterns**: Deviation causes inconsistency and user confusion
2. **Props for Layout Only**: Core styling belongs in components, customization via props
3. **User Preference Priority**: Visual hierarchy and spacing decisions are user-validated
4. **Component Documentation**: All patterns documented in `COMPONENT_PATTERNS.md`
5. **Type Safety**: Maintain TypeScript interfaces matching backend models

### Areas for Future Enhancement
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions between tabs and states
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Loading states for slow connections
- **Accessibility**: Enhanced keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Advanced Visualization**: More sophisticated chart types for complex comparisons
