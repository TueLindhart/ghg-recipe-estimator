# Component Styling Changes

## Overview
We modified several components to improve their flexibility and reusability by making their styles configurable from parent components. This change follows the principle of making components more modular and customizable while maintaining sensible defaults.

## Changes Made

### Custom Components Modified
1. `OverviewCard.svelte`
   - Added `cardClass` prop with default styling
   - Default: `!max-w-none w-full md:w-1/2 lg:w-1/3 bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg shadow p-6 flex flex-col justify-between h-64`
   - Moved Card styling from hardcoded to configurable prop

2. `BudgetComparison.svelte`
   - Refactored to match IngredientCard pattern for info icon
   - Core positioning classes moved to component: `p-4 relative`
   - Simple cardClass prop: `max-w-full`
   - Info button uses standard position classes: `absolute top-2 right-2`
   - Vertical stacking for percentage and label with `flex flex-col items-center`

3. `EquivalentComparison.svelte`
   - Added `cardClass` prop with default styling
   - Default: `max-w-full p-4 space-y-2`
   - Made Card component's class customizable via prop

### Parent Component Changes
Updated `+page.svelte` to explicitly pass class props to child components, demonstrating how to customize component styling from the parent level.

## Best Practices & Patterns

### Core Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep styling separate from logic
- **Customizability with Defaults**: Components should work out of the box with sensible defaults but allow customization
- **Consistency**: Follow a consistent pattern across all similar components

### Implementation Guidelines
1. **Class Props Pattern**
   - Use consistent naming (e.g., `cardClass`)
   - Provide comprehensive default values
   - Pass style classes via props instead of hardcoding

2. **Default Styling**
   - Components should have sensible default styles as prop defaults
   - Parent components can override defaults when needed
   - Maintains flexibility while keeping components reusable

## Implementation Example
```svelte
<!-- Component Definition -->
<script lang="ts">
  export let cardClass = "default-classes-here";
</script>

<Card class={cardClass}>
  <!-- Content -->
</Card>

<!-- Usage in Parent -->
<CustomComponent
  cardClass="override-classes-here"
/>
```

## Future Considerations
1. Consider creating a style system for common patterns
2. Document default styles in component documentation
3. Create a style guide for consistent class prop naming
4. Consider implementing theme support for global style changes

## Consolidation Note

**This document has been consolidated with other styling guidelines**:
- Detailed component patterns: `/agents/projects/redesign-estimate-page/COMPONENT_PATTERNS.md`
- Frontend architecture: `/agents/foodprint/LEARNINGS.md`
- Overall project learnings: `/agents/LEARNINGS.md`

The patterns described here are now part of a comprehensive component design system that ensures consistency across the entire project.

This consolidation eliminates duplicate information and provides clear, non-conflicting guidance for component development.
