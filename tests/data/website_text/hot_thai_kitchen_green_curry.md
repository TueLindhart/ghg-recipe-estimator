Ingredients and Notes
---------------------

Here are ingredients you'll need for an authentic Thai green curry and important notes about them. For amounts, see the . The bamboo shoots are a common vegetable used for green curry, but feel free to change it up. And if you are DIY-minded and have time, here's my .

* **Thai basil**
* **Bamboo shoots,** canned. You can use the strips of sliced version. If you don't like bamboo shoots, you can also substitute Thai eggplant, cut into thin wedges, or winter melon, cut into 1-inch chunks. *But* you will need to allow more cooking time and adjust accordingly: Thai eggplant needs 3-4 minutes, and wintermelon about 10 minutes. If using chicken *breast* the eggplant/wintermelon will have to go in before the chicken.
* **Red bell pepper**, or any kind of red pepper. This is added just for colour.
* **Green curry paste,** store bought or homemade. If using store bought I recommend **Maeploy, Aroy-D, or Namjai brands.** *Do not use Thai Kitchen brand as it is very weak, or if you must, you'll need at last double the amount called for.* See my for details.   
  ***If using my recipe for the ,*** you can put the entire batch of paste into this curry recipe, unless you're afraid it might be too spicy, then you can hold back a bit. Don't use the amount provided for store bought paste because the above-recommended brands tend to be more concentrated than homemade ones.
* **Full fat** , I recommend Aroy-D in paper carton.
* **,** or sub granulated or light brown sugar.
* **Boneless skinless chicken thighs**. Chicken thighs do make the best tasting green curry, but if you must use chicken breast, the method is a little different and I've provided the details in the recipe card.
* **Chicken stock, unsalted**. Store bought is fine but you can also use my

How to Make Thai Green Curry
----------------------------

Green curry uses our basic curry making methods that you'll see in many different coconut-milk-based curry recipes. Once you know how to make a green curry, for example, you basically know ! Here's a bird's eye view of the process, but to ensure success, I highly recommend watching !

1. Optional step: Pound green curry paste and Thai basil leaves for an extra vibrant colour.
2. Get the paste as fine as possible.
3. Reduce the coconut milk until very thick
4. Add the curry paste and saute for a few minutes.

5. Toss chicken with the curry paste.
6. Add coconut milk
7. Add chicken stock
8. Add makrut lime leaves.

9. Add fish sauce and palm sugar.
10. Simmer for 10-15 minutes until the chicken is fork tender.
11. Add bamboo shoots and cook for a minute until the curry comes back to a boil.
12. Stir in red bell pepper and turn off the heat.

13. Add Thai basil and stir just until wilted.
14. The green curry is now ready to serve with jasmine rice!

How to Make Green Curry Vegan
-----------------------------

With a dish so flavourful, making it a vegan is very easy. Here are modifications I suggest below, but **I also have a that I have optimized for maximum umami you should check out!**

* Use any vegan protein of your choice, and if using tofu I recommend medium-firm tofu, or fried tofu made for soup which I use in this
* You can also do an all-veggie green curry without any protein. I recommend hearty vegetables such as Asian mushrooms and Japanese eggplant. Sauteing or roasting the vegetables first so that they are browne will make it more robust-tasting.
* Replace fish sauce with soy sauce, salt, or vegan fish sauce.
* Use vegetable broth instead of chicken stock. Or use dried shiitake soaking water as I do in my .

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

**Which is hotter, red or green curry?**

This is a difficult question to answer because with any Thai curry you can make a very spicy or a very mild one. It just depends on who made the curry paste and also how much curry paste is used. But if you're using store bought curry paste, usually green curry tends to be hotter than red curry, and both of these tend to be hotter than yellow, panang and massaman curry pastes.  

 **What is green curry sauce made of?**

Green curry sauce is quite simple and is made of mainly green curry paste and coconut milk. Water or broth is usually added to lighten the curry, and seasonings are simply fish sauce and sugar. To find out what's in green curry paste, check out .

 **What does green curry paste taste like?**

If you've never had green curry before, it'll be a flavour experience you've never had. If you're thinking of an Indian curry, it is completely different in every way. The flavours come mostly from fresh herbs rather than dry spices, so it won't have that u0022curry aromau0022 you associate with dishes made with curry powder. Texturally it's also much lighter and brothier, more reminiscent of a soup, rather than a thick stew.

### Notes

1. Adding more curry paste will give you a more flavourful curry, but it will also be spicier. As your first batch, start with 50 g of store bought paste and you can add more next time. As for brands, I recommend Maeploy, Aroy-D and Maesri. **Do not use “Thai Kitchen” brand.** . More details in the ingredient section in the blog post above.
2. If using chicken breasts, cut into ½-inch thick, bite-sized slices, and marinate in 2 teaspoons of fish sauce while you prep other ingredients. Follow instructions specific to chicken breasts.
3. Instead of bamboo shoots, you can substitute Thai eggplant cut into thin wedges (3 min cooking time), or winter melon, cut into 1-inch chunks (10 min cooking time).
4. Ideally use Thai green chilies that are about 2 inches long, not the tiny ones. If not available you can also use other types of green chilies such as Korean green chilies or serrano peppers.
