This is an easy weeknight, one-pot meal with lots of flavor and nutrition. It's basically a black bean and chicken chili with a layer of cornbread crust on top, all cooked in a Dutch oven.

Good but a little dry. Chicken pot pie is supposed to be soupy. I would leave the juices from the beans next time or maybe add some chicken broth. Also cut down in the chili powder. 4 Tablespoons is a ton.

This was a great use up food in the pantry dish! Easy, and tasty. I didn't have two cans of black beans so substituted 1 can of black and one can of white. The only issue I had was the cornbread mix called for 1 C milk and two eggs. Since I wasn't sure i should add the extra liquid, I followed the recipe and used just 3/4 cup milk and 1 egg. It turned out great although not nearly as pretty in the photo, since there wasn't quite enough of the cornbread mix to completely cover the dish for baking. Kids still loved it. I used a 6 qt. Dutch oven without the lid. I checked it at 20 mins, and felt it could use an extra 5 mins, so it was done in 25 mins. Garnished w/sour cream and cheddar cheese according to taste.

This was really easy and really delicious! The only change I made was to reduce the amount of chili powder so it wasn’t too spicy for my kids.
