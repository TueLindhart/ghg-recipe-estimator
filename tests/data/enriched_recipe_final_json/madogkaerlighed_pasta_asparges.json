Cook it according to instructions on the package and pour the water off so that it is not cooked further.\nCrack the ends of the green asparagus (the ends cannot be eaten). Cut them into approx. 1 cm long pieces.\nSweat onion and garlic in oil on a hot pan. Add the squash and asparagus and sweat it for a few more minutes, sprinkle with a KNSP salt and a little pepper.\nThen get the water on the pan and crumble the broth cube on to dissolve faster. Pour the cream on with grated parmesan and turn it all around well.\nTurn the fresh pasta into the mixture and finally mozzarella and fresh basil.
