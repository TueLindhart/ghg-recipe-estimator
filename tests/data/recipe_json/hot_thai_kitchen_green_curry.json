    "instructions": "Reduce 0.75 cup coconut milk until thick and coconut oil starts to separate from the coconut milk (if the oil doesn’t separate after it has reduced until very thick, it's okay, just proceed with the recipe).\nAdd the curry paste and sauté, stirring constantly over medium heat for about 2 minutes until aromatic. If paste sticks to the bottom of the pan, you can deglaze with a little bit of the remaining coconut milk.\nAdd chicken thigh and stir to mix with the paste. (Continue with instructions below if using chicken breast).\nAdd the chicken stock, remaining 1 cup of coconut milk, palm sugar and 1 Tablespoon of the fish sauce. Grab the makrut lime leaves and twist them to bruise and release aroma, then tear them into chunks and add them to the pot, discarding the center stems. Bring to a simmer and let simmer gently for 10-15 minutes or until the chicken is fork tender.\nOnce the curry is done simmering, add bamboo shoots and bring to a boil. If you prefer your peppers to be more cooked, add them at this stage. Once boiling, remove from heat.\nTaste and add more fish sauce and/or sugar as needed.\nAdd Thai basil and spur chilies or bell peppers and stir just until the basil is wilted. Serve with jasmine rice"
