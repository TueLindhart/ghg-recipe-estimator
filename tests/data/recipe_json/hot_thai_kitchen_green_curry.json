    "instructions": "Reduce ¾ cup coconut milk until thick and coconut oil starts to separate from the coconut milk. Add the curry paste and sauté, stirring constantly over medium heat for about 2 minutes until aromatic. Add chicken thigh and stir to mix with the paste. Add chicken stock, remaining 1 cup of coconut milk, palm sugar and 1 tablespoon of fish sauce. Grab the makrut lime leaves, twist them to bruise and release aroma, then tear them into chunks and add them to the pot. Bring to a simmer and let simmer gently for 10-15 minutes or until the chicken is fork tender. Once the curry is done simmering, add bamboo shoots and bring to a boil. Taste and add more fish sauce and/or sugar as needed. Add Thai basil and stir just until the basil is wilted. Serve with jasmine rice."
